- Figure and figcaption used along with article and p. Used css to style figcaption so that it aligns with clip-path of image.
    - File: index.html Lines: 20-23.
    - File: styles.css Lines: 38-43, 73-79.
      
- Object-Fit property for the image to maintain its aspect rations within the figure element.
    - File: styles.css Line: 86.
      
- Mix-Blend-Mode: Nomal; used on the image so that it does not interact with background in any way. Was going to give it a blend mode, but decided it made the page too visually busy.

- Clip-Path used to create creative chevron shape to generate visual interest.
    - Files: styles.css Line: 85.
